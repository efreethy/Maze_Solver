# Maze_Solver

This program solves mazes. The solution can be
found in lib/solve_maze.rb

You can run this project from the command line. It takes a maze file path as input
(.txt format), and returns the maze, solved.

You will need to make the project folder (Maze_Solver) your current directory
in order to get things started. Use the following command line argument to run
the project:

      `ruby lib/solve_maze.rb mazes/maze1.txt`

If you wish to solve a different maze, then provide the mazes file path in the
command line argument, like so:

    i.e. `ruby lib/solve_maze.rb mazes/<your_maze_filename>`



Disclaimer: All of the specs rely on the first mazefile `maze1.txt`
